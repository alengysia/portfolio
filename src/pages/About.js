                <p class="about-p"> Hi, my name is Ashley Swank, and I'm a software engineer. I spent the years from 2010 up until September of 2021 as a phlebotomist. 
                    the last six of those eleven years was working for myself as a private contractor. I decided to change careers to software engineering and development
                    when I realized I had maxed out my potential and hit the ceiling in the field I was in, and wanted to pursue something that aligned more with 
                    my personal interests, and gave me more room to grow. While working for myself though, I learned some very valuable tools that helped me on
                    this incredible journey into the tech industry. I learned about bottom lines, and how to represent myself, but more importantly I learned how 
                    to wake up every day and go do my job without anyone telling me to do it. I learned how quickly I can adapt and learn new ways of doing things.
                    I learned how important having a professional but empathetic relationship with patients and clients really is. I also learned more about who I was and what I wanted
                    out of life.
                </p>
                <p class="about-p"> When I realized I had hit the ceiling as a phlebotomist, I had to have a heart to heart with myself about what I wanted to do next and what moves I had to make to get there.
                    I have always loved computers whether it be building them or playing games on them. I absolutely love video games, and among some of my favorites are 
                    games where I could solve puzzles and problem solve. As an avid gamer, I have also always been interested in what makes the engines run.  
                    I am also an artist and I saw making the transition to software development as being a move that made the most sense for me, since I could not only explore 
                    my own creativity, but explore what I love the most about gaming as well: puzzles and problem solving. Software engineering straddled my interests so completely and perfectly,
                    that I found my answer. I set off by first taking a Front End Web development course through General Assembly and absolutely loved it, and it was because of that course
                    I enrolled in the Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp, also through General Assembly. I feel the education I have recieved gave me the tools needed 
                    to make my first steps into this new world. I cannot wait to get started at a new job and learn everything I can about it. I wake up excited every day 
                    at the world of possibilites now in front of me. I am enthusiastic and beyond willing to take the care and time needed to learn anything and everything, 
                    as well as the chance to work with wonderful and like-minded people. I hope I can continue to grow and put some great work in.
