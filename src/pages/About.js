                <p class="about-p"> Hi, my name is Ashley Swank, and I'm a software engineer. I spent the years from 2010 up until September of 2021 as a phlebotomist. 
                    the last six of those eleven years was working for myself as a private contractor. I decided to change careers to software engineering and development
                    when I realized I had maxed out my potential and hit the ceiling in the field I was in, and wanted to pursue something that aligned more with 
                    my personal interests and gave me more room to grow. I have always loved computers whether it be building them or playing games on them. I absolutely love video games, 
                    and among some of my favorites are games where I can solve puzzles and problem solve. As an avid gamer, I have also always been interested in what makes the engines run. As an artist, I 
                    also enjoy being able to explore my own creativity to find creative solutions. I cannot wait to get started at a new job and learn everything I can, as well as the chance to work with wonderful and like-minded people.
